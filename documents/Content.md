# How to impress the admission officers 

## Demonsstration of how I meet their requirements: 
### Academic Excellence: 
strong GPA and exhausted all grad level courses related to my interest area in my institution. 

### Leadership and Initiative: 
spearheaded multiple projects that aims at benefiting the community. See [community invovlement](#community-involvement)

### Community Involvement:
 AI chatbot assistant; international students assistance; YouTube tutorial videos; Notes-sharing app; Study space finder; classmates assistance;

### Self-motivation: 
I have developed a very unique self-motivation system. Unique objective, unique reward system, and unique approach

### Entrapreneurism: 
Both my parents are entrapreners and have their own business in China. My father's company is on drug discovery, and my mother's company is on personal care products. I wish to learn how I can extend her company here at the US. [TODO: search GIT entraprenur strength] (This is not my final goal, the objective of this experience is to provide me with a strong foundation in business skills, which is crucial to developing SOTA AI products (e.g. OpenAI example) )

### Compassion for others: 
I am the most compassionate person I have ever seen, in a unique way. Most people hold strong opinions against people that are stagnant/mediocore or "evil". I truely believe that it is never individuals fault to make any mistakes, it is because their environment and society have not provided them with the correct motivation. This relates to my [vision](#my-vision-of-the-future). 

### Research: 
I have been heavily commited into research. My current research involves simulating and examining human societal behaviors
The current research aim to create more effecient simulation strategies. 
The purpose is to enable easier examination of different "branches". How a different environment can lead to different actions. How different actions impacts life and even society. 


## Valuable asset to the school 

### My vision of the future
I want to build individualize chatbot that brings possibilities to people that do not have a "previleged" education and life. 
- "previledged" education is easy to understand as some people simply can't afford or do not have access to good educations, and that's something already occuring. 
- "previledged" life is something rather complicated
- This is related to my current [research](#research)
- The personal assistant could provide new perspectives and motivations based on individuals goals, support for individuals that grow up in unhealthy relationships, provide alert and help to people with emerging immoral thoughts/behaviors, and foster upright value systems. (TODO: share examples on how new perspectives, new motivations, new support have very dramatically transformed my life. There is a severe lack of self-development all around the world)

### Make the community at gatch better 

#### Ease transition of incoming students (What I've already done in my current institution)

#### Create AI club

### Valuable Future investment

#### I will become a successful alumni 

#### I wish to pursue the PHD degree at gatech 

## How I have changed after arriving at GaTech
### Dedication to improve communication
I have
### I actually find a reason to start my day. 
Previous motivation: use studying to alleviate anxiety (That explains why I was aiming to become a PhD student)
The motivation after I arrive: I am ready to embrace something new every day. Every conversation, every interaction I have, bring me new perspectives make me learn things. 

### The healthy form of competitiveness
A lot of things I have heard around people 
## My motivation: 

### More about myself: 
- dedicatino to work and sleeping at school
- over-confidence and arrogence: I believe arrogence is a bad thing, but might be a crucial component in order to be sucessful. If that is the case, I would take the blame and implement this trait. 

### How I have changed drastically with the help of AI


# What I love about Georgia Tech
collaborative: I have always interacted with people who do not hold a strong will for success, or people who tries to hinder their peers in order to success. The collaborativeness of what I've seen and what I've heard is absolutely a seridipitious moment, where people have strong pursuits, but also wish each other success. 
applicative
people have either a clear passion or goal in mind. 

- Competitive environment. I have exhausted existing education resources at my current institution. 
- Gatch is strong at HCI, a crucial component for building successful models that aligns with human needs and are easy to use. 
- Careern futures
- PhD Program
- Entrepreneour capabilities. All kinds of support for entreprenurship and how cutting edge research could be related/transformed into businesses. (e.g. the Venture Lab, whose main focus is to provide commercialization support to transform reserach into startups)



# How I should ask
Ask the admissions where they would like to start hearing from 

All my actions are explainable and I'd be willing to explalin 

Build an assistant to demonstrate the usefulness. allowing it to answer questions for me. 

Why I take the risk: The best case I win the chance of getting into my dream school. (I would not talk about the worst case, since that would decrease my chances of getting into the school The worst case I gain valuable scar tissue and experience that benefits me in the long run. )

It would be a great value to me


first gen parents. 
How I can really apply my knowledge to real world; which I did not have the chance before, my passion was on research 
I've never seen so many students in my life
